TilesheetStage3D
================

This is a class which extends openfl.display.Tilesheet and adds stage3D support to the drawTiles method, if available.

Currently it's not very fast at rendering lots of sprites, but at least, it's much better than default Flash fallback(In tilelayer).
Also it has much lower CPU consumption.
